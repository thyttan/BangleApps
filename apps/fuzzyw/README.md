# Fuzzy Text Clock

An imprecise clock for when you're not in a rush.

This clock is a remake of one of my favourite Pebble watchfaces, Fuzzy Text International. I use this watch for weekends and holidays, when 'within 5 minutes of the actual time' is close enough!

By default it will use the language set on the watch, go to settings to pick:
*  en_GB - English
*  en_US - American
*  es_ES - Spanish
*  fr_FR - French
*  no_NO - Norwegian
*  sv_SE - Swedish
*  de_DE - German

Most translations are taken from the original Fuzzy Text International code.

## TODO
* Bold hour word (as the pebble version has)
* Animation when changing time?
