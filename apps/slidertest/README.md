# Slider Test app

- 1: A volume slider that hides when not interacted with. It uses the
  mapping feature if draging on the slider, and the incrementing feature
  if draging just beside it.
- 2: A hidden slider that increments a preview of a change to the
  backdrop color. When the user stops interacting with it the backdrop
  is updated.
- 3: An always visible slider that controls the brightness level.
- 4: A non-interactable progressbar that follows the position in a media
  track playing on a connected android device.

A square will blink when messages with music state arrives.
