#### To speed-up GPS reception it is strongly recommended to upload AGPS data with ["Assisted GPS Update"](https://banglejs.com/apps/?id=assistedgps)

#### If "CALIB!" is shown on the display or the compass heading differs too much from GPS heading, compass calibration should be done with the ["Navigation Compass" App](https://banglejs.com/apps/?id=magnav)
